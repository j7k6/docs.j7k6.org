## Problem
When I tried using *Robocopy* to sync network shares, it suddenly failed with this error message:
```
Not enough storage is available to process this command
```

## Solution
1. Open `regedit.exe` (with admin rights)
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` > `SYSTEM` > `CurrentControlSet` > `Services` > `LanmanServer` > `Parameters`
3. Create new *DWORD (32-bit) Value* `IRPStackSize` with a decimal value higher than *15* (e.g. *40*).
4. Reboot computer
