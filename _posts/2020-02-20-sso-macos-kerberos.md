## Kerberos Tickets
To enable Kerberos authentification, a Kerberos ticket needs to be generated on the macOS client. This ticket can be aquired on the commandline (or use the `Ticket Viewer.app` GUI version):

```bash
kinit <$USERNAME>@EXAMPLE.org
```

Unfortunately, Kerberos tickets are only vaid for a couple of hours, but macOS doesn't automatically renew them. There is a free tool for that: [Kerberos Ticket Autorenewal](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1246781916).

## Browser Configuration
### Chrome
Run these commands and restart Chrome:
```bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome AuthServerWhitelist '*.example.org'
defaults write com.google.Chrome AuthNegotiateDelegateWhitelist '*.example.org'
```

### Firefox
Go to `about:config` and apply the following settings:

|`network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris`|*https://test.example.org*|
|`network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris`|*https://test.example.org*|
|`network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris`|*https://test.example.org*|

### Safari
Safari doesn't need any further configruation.
