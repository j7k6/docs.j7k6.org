## Disable HDMI
> This will reduce the power consumption by ~30mA.

Add `/usr/bin/tvservice -o` to */etc/rc.local* (right before the `exit 0` line).

## Disable the ACT LED
> The *ACT* LED indicates network and disk activity, turning it off will reduce the overall power consumption a tiny bit more.

Add these lines to */boot/config.txt*:
```
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off
```
