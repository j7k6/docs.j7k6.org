## Prerequirements
1. Set up [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com) to answer DNS requests for your domain.
2. Build a static site with [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/) (obviously.)
3. Create a `CNAME` file inside the local repository:
   ```bash
   echo "docs.j7k6.org" > CNAME
   ```

## GitHub
1. Create a GitHub repository and push the contents of the local Jekyll repository to it.
2. Navigate to the GitHub repositories' *Settings* page and scroll down the the *GitHub Pages* section to active the hosting by selecting the master branch as *Source*:
   ![github-ghpages](/files/jekyll-static-site-github-pages-cloudflare-https/ghpages-01.png)

## Cloudflare
1. Create a new *CNAME* DNS record for the desired domain in the *DNS* settings panel:
   ![cloudflare-dns](/files/jekyll-static-site-github-pages-cloudflare-https/ghpages-02.png)
   > The *Name* field is either the subdomain part or `@` if the site will not be served as a subdomain. The *Domain name* field is `<$GITHUB_USERNAME>`*.github.io*.
2. Navigate to the *Page Rules* section and create a new page rule:
   ![cloudflare-https](/files/jekyll-static-site-github-pages-cloudflare-https/ghpages-03.png)
   > This rule will redirect any page request to HTTPS, so it's always served encrypted.

That's it! Every push to the GitHub repository will now trigger a new Jekyll build and update your static site automatically.

## Purge Cloudflare Cache (optional)
Cloudflare's cache prevents an update to the site to be shown immediately after a push to *origin/master* has been made. To purge the cache on every push to the GitHub repository, follow [this steps](/github-pages-cloudflare-cache-reset/).
