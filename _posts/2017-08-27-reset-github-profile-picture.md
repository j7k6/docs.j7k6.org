For some reason its not possible to directly reset your Github profile picture. To set the original *identicon*, download it from [https://github.com/identicons/GITHUB_USERNAME.png](https://github.com/identicons/GITHUB_USERNAME.png) and re-upload it on the [Github Profile Settings](https://github.com/settings/profile).
