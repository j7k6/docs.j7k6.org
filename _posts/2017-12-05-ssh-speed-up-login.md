If logging into an SSH server takes a long time, this configuration modifications might help:

1. In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` make sure those lines are set or uncommented:
   ```
   GSSAPIAuthentication no
   GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
   UseDNS no
   ```
2. In `/etc/nsswitch.conf` set the values like this:
   ```
   passwd:         compat
   group:          compat
   shadow:         compat
   ```
