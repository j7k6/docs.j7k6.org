This is a collection of free macOS GUI tools that get shit done!


## f.lux
*f.lux* sets the screen's color temperature to calm the eyes at night time. [<https://justgetflux.com>]

## Secure Pipes
*Secure Pipes* manages SSH port forwardings, so it's not neccessary to open up a SSH connection in the terminal to create a local or remote port forwarding. [<https://www.opoet.com/pyro/>]

## Spectacle
*Spectacle* is a small little tool, which performs a task very well which macOS for some reason doesn't offer: managing window layouts with simple keystrokes. [<https://www.spectacleapp.com>]

## Caffeine
*Caffeine* prevents your Mac going to sleep. That's it. [<http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/>]

## Transmission
*Transmission* is a minimal BitTorrent client, which serves its purpose very well. So many BitTorrent clients are bloated and unsuable, *Transmission* keeps it simple. [<https://transmissionbt.com>]

## iTerm2
Yes, *iTerm2* is a terminal emulator, but somehow it's a GUI tool. It's the best replacement for the stock macOS *Terminal.app*. [<https://www.iterm2.com>]

## Tunnelblick
*Tunnelblick* is a simple OpenVPN client and nothing more. [<https://tunnelblick.net>]

## AppCleaner
*AppCleaner* removes macOS applications from disk completely, including all settings and related file clutter. [<https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/>]

## RealVNC Viewer
Although macOS has an integrated VNC client, *RealVNC viewer* is the better choice in most cases. [<https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/>]

## VLC
Pure and simple, *VLC* is the best mediaplayer ever. Although the UI is not the nicest, it's simple and perforce well. [<https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.de.html>]

## The Unarchiver
*The Unarchiver* is more feature-rich than the build-in macOS archiving app. [<https://theunarchiver.com>]

## Cyberduck
*Cyberduck* is a clean and simple file-transfer tool. It supports FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3 and many more. [<https://cyberduck.io>]

## Microsoft Remote Desktop
Even better than the original Windows RDP client. Best feature: Clipboard sharing between local macOS and remote Windows system. [<https://itunes.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop-10/id1295203466?mt=12>]

## Sublime Text
Although I use ***Sublime Text*** mainly for note taking, it really is a great code editor besides that. Way more performant than it's alternative *Atom*.  [<https://www.sublimetext.com>]

## Google Chrome
Of course. [<https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html>]
